# Creating a Screen and Shortcut
<hr />

Extensions can have multiple screens in the app. Screens are [React components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html) that represent a mobile screen. We want the extension to have 2 screens: one for the list of the restaurants and another for the details of each particular restaurant the user taps.

Since the app needs to know which screen to open the first for some extension, we need to create a ***shortcut*** when creating that screen. A shortcut is a link to the starting screen of an extension. It's the item in the app navigation which opens the starting screen when a user taps on it.

The list of restaurants is going to be the first screen, so let's create it and give it a shortcut:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem screen add List --shortcut Restaurants
Enter shortcut information:
Title: Restaurants

Screen `List` is created in file `app/screens/List.js`!
Shortcut `Restaurants` is created.
Shortcut `Restaurants` opens `List` screen.
File `app/extension.js` was modified.
File `extension.json` was modified.
```

Your `extension.json` was just modified:

```json{7-14}
#file: extension.json
{
  "name": "restaurants",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "platform": "1.0.*",
  "title": "Restaurants",
  "description": "List of restaurants",
  "screens": [{
    "name": "List"
  }],
  "shortcuts": [{
    "name": "Restaurants",
    "title": "Restaurants"
    "screen": "@.List"
  }]
}
```

The screen and shortcut were added to `extension.json` inside arrays. The `name` property uniquely identifies these extension parts. Shortcut's `title` is what will be shown in the app navigation. The `screen` property inside `shortcuts` references the screen that will open when a user taps on that shortcut in navigation.

When referencing any extension part, we need to say which extension it came from. The full name of extension part follows this structure: `<developer-name>.<extension-name>.<extension-part-name>` (e.g. `{{ site.example.devName }}.restaurants.List)`. For extension parts within the same extension, you can just use `@.<extension-part-name>` (e.g. `@.List`). `@.` stands for `<developer-name>.<extension-name>.` of the current extension.

The Shoutem CLI also created `app/screens/` folder with a `List.js` file:

```javascript
#file: app/screens/List.js
import React, {
  Component
} from 'react';

import {
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  View
} from 'react-native';

export default class List extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>Hello World!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
  },
});
```

In React, `Component` specifies its UI in the `render` method.

## Extension in the App

The `app` folder from your extension will be bundled with the rest of the extensions your app uses into a singular, complete app. If your extension uses some `npm` package, install it inside the `app` folder. Below is an example of installing [React Native swiper](https://github.com/leecade/react-native-swiper) (just an example, no need to execute following 2 commands).

Locate to the `app` folder and install the package with saving the dependency in the `package.json`:

```ShellSession
$ cd app/
$ npm install --save react-native-swiper
```

This package would be installed upon bundling your extension into the app. You would be able to access it in any file in the `app` folder.

## Exporting Extension Parts

The app expects extensions to export their parts (e.g. screens) in `app/index.js` (that's standard JS practice). Extensions are like libraries and other extensions can reuse what they export from `app/index.js`. The convention is that `app/index.js` is the public API of an extension and shouldn't be changed often.

The current `index.js` looks like this:

```JSX
#file: app/index.js
// Reference for app/index.js can be found here:
// http://shoutem.github.io/docs/extensions/reference/extension-exports

import * as extension from './extension.js';

export const screens = extension.screens;

export const themes = extension.themes;
```

On the other hand, `app/extension.js` is managed by the CLI and you should not change it. When creating screens, the CLI writes their location in `app/extension.js` which are exported in `app/index.js`.

Upload your extension:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Go to `Custom` under `Add Screen` modal in Shoutem builder. You can finally see your `Restaurants` starting screen (shortcut) there.
=======
Open the `Add screen` modal in the Builder and select the `Custom` category. You can now see your `Restaurants` starting screen (the shortcut).
>>>>>>> origin/master

<p class="image">
<img src='{{ site.url }}/img/my-first-extension/add-modal-shortcut.png'/>
</p>

> #### Note
> In case you don't see it, refresh the page in browser.

Click on `Restaurants` to insert that shortcut into your app's navigation.

Let's preview your app now. We can preview it in the Builder, but it might take some time while the app preview shows. Every time you change an extension, we need to rebundle the whole app to the new extension. It's much faster to use **Shoutem Preview** app (available for [iOS]({{ site.shoutem.previewAppiOS }}) and [Android]({{ site.shoutem.previewAppAndroid }})) and Shoutem CLI, which can bundle only the changes made in the extension.

Since the app is managed through the Builder, we needed to `push` the extension to Shoutem after creating a screen and shortcut to add them to app navigation. However, when we're only changing the app code, we don't need to `push`. Instead, we can use `shoutem link` to tell Shoutem CLI to bundle the local code of your extension.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem link
Extension successfully linked. Please, kill the packager before running the app.
```

Once extension is linked, run the app to start the [React Native packager](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/packager):

```ShellSession
$ shoutem run
Select your app: Restaurants ({{ site.example.appId }})
Creating the bundle for your app...
...
```

The CLI will print a QR code for you to scan using the Shoutem Preview app, if you don't have the app, you can get it using the link printed above the QR code. After it's installed, the Shoutem Preview app will automatically your app.

> #### Note
> In the documentation the preview you see is from the Builder, instead of a screenshot from the Shoutem Preview app. This way you'll see the state of the web interface as well. If you only change your app code, just shake your phone with the Shoutem Preview app on and tap the "Reload" button. If you [`link` your extension]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/setting-local-environment), you won't need to do `shoutem push` every time you change the app code!

This is the result:

<p class="image">
<img src='{{ site.url }}/img/my-first-extension/extension-hello-world.png'/>
</p>

Your app only has a simple _Hello World_ screen. Let's add some UI components.
