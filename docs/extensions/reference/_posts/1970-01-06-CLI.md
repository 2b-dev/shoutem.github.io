# Shoutem CLI
Shoutem Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you build extensions. Using it, you can create extensions, generate code snippets, upload extensions to your Shoutem account and install them on your apps.

## Installation
Download and install Shoutem CLI through `npm`, the package manager for `Node.js`.

```ShellSession
$ npm install -g @shoutem/cli
```

If the previous command fails because of permission issues, you need to run it with `sudo` permission: `sudo npm install -g @shoutem/cli`.

<br />
In case you don't have `npm` installed, the best way to install it is with [installing](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `Node.js`, which includes `npm`.

## Commands

Here is the list of available commands with their arguments and flags. Some of the arguments and flags are not documented, which we only found useful for the Shoutem team internally (they can still be seen when using `help` commands). <br />

- ##### shoutem

Lists all the commands.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem
Usage: shoutem [command] [-h]

Commands:
...
```

- ##### shoutem [\--version|-v]

Prints out the CLI version.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem -v
1.0.0
```

- ##### shoutem \<cmd> [\--help|-h]

Every command's description and arguments list can be invoked using -h flag.
So for example, the command `shoutem init -h` prints usage info for the init command and `shoutem screen add -h` prints usage info for the `shoutem screen add` command:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init -h

Usage: shoutem init <extension-name>

Create a scaffold of all files and folders required to build an extension.
```

- ##### shoutem login

Authenticates you as a developer. Enter your Shoutem credentials. If you're not a Shoutem user yet, sign up [here]({{ site.shoutem.builderURL }}).

```ShellSession
$ shoutem login
Enter your Shoutem credentials (obtained at {{ site.shoutem.builderURL }}):
E-mail: {{ site.example.devEmail }}
Password: ********
```

Each Shoutem user can become a Shoutem developer. If you're not a developer yet, you'll be prompted to create a developer name after entering your credentials.

```ShellSession
Enter new developer name:
Name: {{ site.example.devName }}
You are registered as `{{ site.example.devName }}`!
```

- ##### shoutem logout

Logs you out from the CLI.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem logout
Successfully logged out.
```

- ##### shoutem init \<extension-name>

Initializes an extension project.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init {{ site.example.extensionName }}
Enter information about your extension. Press `return` to accept (default) values.

Title: Restaurants
Version: 0.0.1
Description: List of restaurants
...
Extension initialized!
```

After initialization, your extension folder structure will look as follows:

```
{{ site.example.devName }}.restaurants/
  ├ app/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  ├ extension.js
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
  ├ server/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  └ package.json
  └ extension.json
```

> #### Note
> `{{ site.example.devName }}` and `restaurants` are just used as an example.

Run this command from the extension folder.

- ##### shoutem push

Pushes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

As long as extension is not published, every `push` will overwrite current development version of extension. Once you `publish` extension, that version of extension will be unchangeable and you will be able to `push` only higher version numbers.

Run this command from the extension folder.

- ##### shoutem publish

Publishes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem publish
Publishing `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Version `0.0.1` is successfully published!
```

Run this command from the extension folder.

- ##### shoutem install [\--new [\<restaurant-name>]] [\--app \<app-id>]

Installs extension to the app. If no flags or arguments are passed, the CLI will offer an interactive menu.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install
Select app to install your extension:
> RestaurantsApp
  --------------
  Create a new app
```

Pass a flag `--new` to install it on a new app.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install --new Restaurants
Installing `Restaurnats` extension to the new app...
Extension successfully installed to the new app. Check it here:
{{ site.shoutem.builderURL }}/app/{{ site.example.appId }}
```

Also, you can install it on specific a app by providing an app ID. To find out ID of the app, go to **Settings** and scroll down to **Advanced information** section of the **App info**.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install --app {{ site.example.appId }}
Installing `Restaurnats` extension to `Restaurants` app...
Extension successfully installed to the app. Check it here:
{{ site.shoutem.builderURL }}/app/{{ site.example.appId }}
```

Installation can be done through Builder as well by going to the Extensions tab in the sidebar, clicking on the `+` button next to `Extensions` to open the Extension Marketplace and then selecting the `My extensions` tab.

- ##### shoutem screen add \<screen-name> [\--shortcut \<shortcut-name>]

Adds a [screen]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/my-first-extension/shortcut-and-screen) to the extension.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem screen add List
Screen `List` is created in file `app/screens/List.js`!
File `app/extension.js` was modified.
File `extension.json` was modified.
```

Pass the `--shortcut` option with the shortcut's name as a value to create a screen and connect it with a new shortcut in `extension.json`.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem screen add List --shortcut List
Enter shortcut information:
Title: List

Screen `List` is created in file `app/screens/List.js`!
Shortcut `List` is created!
Shortcut `List` opens `List` screen.

File `extension.json` was modified.
```

Run this command from the extension folder.

- ##### shoutem theme add \<theme-name>

```ShellSession
$ shoutem theme add Argo
Theme `Argo` is created in file `app/themes/Argo.js`.
Variables for the theme are created in file `server/themes/ArgoVariables.json`
File `extension.json` was modified.
```

- ##### shoutem show

Home directory: `/path/to/.shoutem` (customizable through SHOUTEM_CLI_HOME env variable)
```

- ##### shoutem run [\<app-id>] [\--dev] [\--local] [\--small]

Executes the React Native packager locally to **run** and **debug** react-native apps using the **Shoutem Preview** app (available for [iOS]({{ site.shoutem.previewAppiOS }}) and [Android]({{ site.shoutem.previewAppAndroid }})) on both Android and iOS without having to setup Android Studio and/or XCode. Moreover, you can use Windows to develop iOS apps. The only requirement for running the app is `Node.js` v6 or higher. See our [FAQ]({{ site.url }}/docs/extensions/tutorials/faq) if you have problems setting this up.

Just change directory to a Shoutem (or any react-native) app and run `shoutem run`.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem run
...
{{ site.example.qrCodeLink }}
`Printed QR code`
```

You can scan the QR code containing the app URL using **Shoutem Preview** app (available for [iOS]({{ site.shoutem.previewAppiOS }}) and [Android]({{ site.shoutem.previewAppAndroid }})) or any other QR code reader. Regular QR code readers should open and/or install the Shoutem Preview app, which will automatically open the requested app.

Upon reading the QR code, Shoutem Preview will connect to your computer and embed the JS code within itself. You can now see how your app behaves and feels on a real device without ever having to build or pull the native code. By default, `shoutem run` bundles the **release** build (See [Building your app for production](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html#building-your-app-for-production).

`shoutem run --dev` If you want to debug your extensions using this method, use the `--dev` flag with `shoutem run`. This will create `debug` build. The app performance will be a bit slower, but this will allow you to use Chrome/Safari/Firefox debug tools.

`shoutem run --local` By default, React Native packager is tunneled through [ngrok]((https://ngrok.com/). Use `--local` flag if you are connected with your smartphone to the same network as your computer. This will allow Shoutem Preview app to fetch the JS bundle directly from your computer, which will reduce the delay in refreshing code changes. Also, your computer must be able to open `8081` port. This might require manual configuration of your computer's firewall settings.

`shoutem run --small` Creates a smaller QR code. Useful if you don't like resizing the terminal, but tends to cause problems with rendering for some terminal fonts.

> #### Note
> When using `shoutem run` to preview your app on a device, your extensions must not include any native code. The reason behind this is that you can't change the native code of the Shoutem Preview app on the fly. If your extension has native functionalities, use `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` from the root app directory..

- ##### shoutem clone [\<app-id>]

Clones a complete app project which includes the [Shoutem platform](https://github.com/shoutem/platform) and all extensions installed in the app (you can see them in `Extensions` tab in the Builder). Useful for running and figuring out the details of how a complete Shoutem app works, and to help you understand how extension code integrates with the app itself. The command will create a directory with the same name as the app being pulled with the app id suffixed. The directory will have an `extensions` directory containing the source code of all extensions installed in the given app.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem clone
Select your app: Restaurants ({{ site.example.appId }})
Pulling the app `Restaurants`...
Cloning `Restaurants` to `Restaurants`
Done.

To run your app on iOS:
    cd C:\Users\ikatun\Desktop\test\Restaurants
    react-native run-ios
To run your app on Android:
    cd C:\Users\ikatun\Desktop\test\Restaurants
    Have an Android simulator running or a device connected
    react-native run-android
```

- ##### shoutem pack

Packs the extension. This command is used by `shoutem push` and with it, you can check how your extensions looks like when it's pushed to Shoutem servers.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem pack
Extension is packed at: ~/restaurants.tgz
```

Find the extension packed in the root of the extension folder.

By default, `shoutem pack` command will do `npm run build` in both `app` and `server` folder, which is performed also on `shoutem push`. If you don't want to get the pack without building it, use `shoutem pack --nobuild` (not documented flag).


Run this command from the extension folder.

- ##### shoutem configure [--release]

Runs the platform's configure script to sync the local app with native changes to local extensions.
The flag `--release` is used to switch the local app to the last published configuration on the server.
Call the `shoutem configure` command again without the flag to switch back to the current development configuration.

The command should be called when:
- new extension is created, installed to the current app & pushed
- changing native code of any of the extensions from the extensions/ directory
- changing cocoapods or gradle dependencies of any of the extensions from the extensions/ directory
- switching between published (`shoutem configure --release`) and development (`shoutem configure`) configuration

```ShellSession
$ shoutem configure
Starting build for app {{ site.example.appID }}
```

Run this command from the application folder.

- ##### shoutem whoami

Displays the username of current developer.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem whoami
{{ site.example.devName }}
```
