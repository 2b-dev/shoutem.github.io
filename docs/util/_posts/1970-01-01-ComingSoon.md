# Coming soon!

Although before releasing our product, we wanted to make documentation for literally everything, it turned out to be a very long process. As much as we want to make great platform, we also want to make a good documentation that follows the quality of our platform. That's why we decided to release documentation for most of the things and to document the rest as we build our platform.
